## Open Access Button Prototype

A prototype version of the Open Access Button idea explained in [this blog](http://oabutton.wordpress.com/2013/07/06/our-project-short-version/).

#### Demo

[Have a look at the demo](http://oabutton.herokuapp.com/) - however **please do not share too widely as we're pre-launch!**

#### Contributing

If you want to contribute, we have some [instructions for setting up your local dev environment](https://github.com/OAButton/OAButton/blob/develop/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

Our code is completely open source and we invite/need developers to get involved in this amazing project. Currently we're trying to focus on attaining [our minimum viable product](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5NV6PoUPiB8GmxRvIO0onDnv8bV69BeDGDco9uHxik/edit) before moving into our testing phase, provisionally on 1 October 2013. That should allow us to launch during Open Access Week, 21 October 2013! If you have suggestions we are more than open to them, however, and post this date we can think about broader development.

As mentioned, we're working to a tight deadline and many people are counting on this tool launching in Open Access Week so please try to work on [high priority issues](https://github.com/OAButton/OAButton/issues). Also, we discuss the projects development more broadly on our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/open-access-button). Where possible open ended questions should be made here, rather than in issues.
