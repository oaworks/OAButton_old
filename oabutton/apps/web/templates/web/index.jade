                        | People are denied access to research hidden behind paywalls every day. This problem is invisible, but it slows innovation, kills curiosity and harms patients. This is an indictment of the current system. Open Access has given us the solution to this problem by allowing everyone to read and re-use research. 
                        | We created the Open Access Button to track the impact of paywalls and help you get access to the research you need. By using the Open Access Button you’ll help show the impact of this problem, drive awareness of the issue, and help change the system. As if this wasn’t enough, the Open Access Button has several ways of helping you get access to the research you need right now.

                        | The first step is using the Open Access Button (and you are using it, daily, on every paywall, right?). But don’t think that’s all there is to do! This project was made possible by developers, advocates, students and general clever folk from Open community and we need continued support to take this to the next level. Of course, the code, text, and data we’ve pulled together are openly available, so you can innovate and advocate with it. If you can, donate to the project to help us support and maintain service as well as helping us with our future development plans. Bottom line, we’d love to hear from you, so whether it’s a suggestion, virtual pat on the back, or, dare I say a bug you’ve noticed, get in touch.
